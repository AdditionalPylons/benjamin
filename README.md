# Benjamin

A Flask-based web-app that uses the Twilio SMS API, Benjamin listens to incoming transaction messages, parses them, and stores them in a database for later recall. An intuitive natural language parsing system for transactions and querying expenses, as well as newly added over-budget warnings enable cash-first users to easily set a budget and stay on top of it!

Coming soon: WhatsApp integration!
